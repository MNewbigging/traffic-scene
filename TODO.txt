Driving Logic

Cars should:

- slow down for the car in front 
- give way 
- adhere to traffic lights 

Cars should not:

- slow down/give way to certain lanes (e.g opposite lanes on bends)
- drive inside another

Have now:

- Each road has a number of lanes
- Each car has a ref to current road and current lane

Could have:

- Lanes could have a ref to the road they're part of 
- A lane could have a ref to lanes it gives way to on that road
